No clouds in my stones Let it rain ; I hydroplane into fame Comin' down at the Dow Jones When the clouds come , we gone We Rocafella fly higher than weather In G5's or better You know me In anticipation for precipitation stack chips for the rainy day Rain man is back with little Ms. Sunshine Rihanna , where you at? You have my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star Baby, 'cause in the dark You can't see shiny cars And that's when you need me there With you I'll always share Because When the sun shines, we shine together Told you be here forever Said I'll always be your friend Took an oath that I'm a stick it out till the end Now that it's raining more than ever Know that we still have each other You can stand under my umbrella These fancy things will never come in between
You're part of my entity, here for infinity When the world has took its part has dealt its cards If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart Because You can run into my arms It's okay, don't be alarmed There's no distance in between our love So I'm gonna let the rain pour I'll be all you need and more You can always come into me Come into me
