Turn around , I get a little bit lonely And you're never coming round around, a bit tired Of listening to the sound of my tears , I get a little bit nervous That the best of all the years have gone by , bit terrified And then I see the look in your eyes bright eyes , but I fall apart And I need you now tonight more than ever if you only hold me tight We'll be holding on forever And we'll only be making it right 'Cause we'll never be wrong together We can take it to the end of the line Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time all of the time I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks Forever's gonna start tonight Once upon a time I was falling in love But now I'm only falling apart And there's nothing I can do A total eclipse of the heart there was light in my life , but now theres only love in the dark
